Purpose: Converting excel file (.xlsx) to import data into database (SQLite)

Step 1: Using Power Query in Excel to filter data appropriately for data migration
Step 2: Drop your excel file (.xlsx) into https://sqlizer.io/#/ and select sql language you want to convert to.
	(Unfortunately, there are no conversion to SQLite language so choose MS SQL instead)
Step 3: Download the converted file (.sql) and modifying MS SQL Syntax into SQLite Syntax in the file
Step 4: Create database in SQLite (I use DB Browser for SQLite)
Step 5: Open the converted file (.sql) and execute the query. Done.
